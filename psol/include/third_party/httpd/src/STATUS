CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.  Note 2.2.18 contained an incompatible ABI change,
    subsequently corrected, and should not be referenced.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

  * mod_cache: Realign the cache_quick_handler() to behave identically
    to the default_handler() when reacting to errors when writing to the
    filter stack. Stops APR errors appearing in access_log as result codes.
    Trunk patches: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1003913
    2.2.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~minfrin/httpd-mod_cache-errorfix-22.patch
    +1: minfrin
    trawick: any reason it shouldn't be completely aligned with default_handler's
             choice to return OK vs. 500?
    rpluem: Agreed with trawick. They should behave the same.

   * mod_ssl: Add support for Next Protocol Negotiation.
     Trunk patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1332643
     2.2.x patch:
       http://www.links.org/files/npn-patch-2.2.patch
     +1: benl
     sf notes: needs the buffer overflow fix from r1345599, too
     wrowe notes: also needs correction to
       ssl_engine_kernel.c: In function 'ssl_callback_AdvertiseNextProtos':
       ssl_engine_kernel.c:2140:5: warning: implicit declaration of function
                                   'modssl_run_npn_advertise_protos_hook'
                  Including mod_ssl.h after ssl_private.h seems to suffice.
                  The change introduces hard linkages from modules into
                  mod_ssl.so (distinct from httpd), AP is the incorrect
                  namespace, see mod_dav main hooks as an example.
                  Prior to this patch all calls to mod_ssl were by way of
                  registered functions through apr bindings.  Seems there
                  aught to be a way to add an npn cooperating module when
                  mod_ssl is not loaded, but right now it would fail.
                  An mmn minor bump would also be required for API addition.

   * modules/ldap/util_ldap.c: Correct erroneous messages
     PR: 53402
     trunk and 2.4.x: Erroneous message about LDAPSharedCacheSize
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&sortby=date&revision=1096577
     trunk and 2.4.x: Erroneous order for the parameters
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&sortby=date&revision=627637
     2.2.x patch: attached in PR 53402 (https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=29502)
     +1: jailletc36
     -1: rjung
     rjung: the proposed 2.2 patch also changes LDAPTrustedClientCert to OR_AUTHCFG.
            This change seems to come from PR46541 which needs a bigger backport (r915660)
            Note: covener commented it in the PR as "I don't think LDAPTrustedClientCert can
            really be made usable in 2.2.".
     rjung: I don't understand what was voted on, the backport of both revisions
            or only the PR attachment. The latter is only about r627637.
     covener: withdrawing my vote, I reviewed the attachment but missed the OR_AUTHCFG change.

  * core: Support wildcards in both the directory and file components of
    the path specified by the Include directive.
    Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=909878&view=rev
                 http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=917735&view=rev
                 http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=917759&view=rev
    2.2.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~minfrin/httpd-wildcard+docs2.patch
    Submitted by: minfrin, poirier
    +1: minfrin, jim, poirier
    -1: wrowe [This introduces new invalid paths which do not resolve to any
               configuration file paths, increasing the probability of unreported
               syntax errors to further confuse the administrator.]

  * srclib/pcre and vendor/pcre
    http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/pkg-pcre.html

    update to pcre-7.8
    outcome: remove from trunk, leave alone in branches/2.2.x and branches/2.0.x

 * core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
   with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
   original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
   with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
   providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
   Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
   which can accept additional mode and flag data.  Convert common
   provider version strings to macros.
   The core purpose of this pile of patches is to avoid unnecessary
   authn/z hooks when a single request spawns large numbers of internal
   requests to which an identical set of httpd configurations apply.
   This permits modules such as mod_authn_dbd and mod_dav to work together
   acceptably.
   Because certain external modules such as mod_authz_svn rely on the old
   behaviour, this optimization can be made only when all authn/z hooks and
   providers are registered with the appropriate flag.
   It would be excellent if Windows and NetWare people could ensure this
   builds correctly.
   In particular, mod_auth.h must be included into request.c and I've left
   mod_auth.h under modules/aaa rather than try to replicate wrowe's work
   in trunk moving all the include files around.
   I'm open to suggestions that this remain in trunk only, but in that case,
   it would be very helpful to know whether most people expect a 2.4 branch
   or just a 3.0 branch to be next.  If 3.0, some of the backwards
   compatibility work could potentially be ditched.

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).

 * prefork MPM: simple patch to enable mod_privileges.

               drop_privileges hook).

 * unixd: set suexec_enabled correctly when httpd is run by non-root
   PR 42175
   Trunk Patch: http://cvs.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=791337
   2.2.x Patch: https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=20004
   +1: niq
   -0: wrowe; Please refer to man 'access' BUGS section about linux 2.4
              vs 2.6 kernels, potentially a suspect test for root.
   sf:        Couldn't the linux 2.4 bug be worked around by calling access
              twice? Once with R_OK and once with X_OK.
   wrowe:     It would seem we only need to test for X_OK?

 * mod_disk_cache: Decline the opportunity to cache if the response is
    a 206 Partial Content. This stops a reverse proxied partial response
    from becoming cached, and then being served in subsequent responses.
    Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=951222&view=rev
    2.2.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~minfrin/httpd-cache-partial-2.2.patch
    +1: minfrin
    niq asks: I can see the logic of not cacheing partial responses,
    but why should mod_disk_cache worry about them if mod_cache allows
    them, as in the following proposal?
    rpluem says: As poirier correctly mentions, the same must be done for mod_mem_cache
    as well.

  *) mod_cache: Explicitly allow cache implementations to cache a 206 Partial
     Response if they so choose to do so. Previously an attempt to cache a 206
     was arbitrarily allowed if the response contained an Expires or
     Cache-Control header, and arbitrarily denied if both headers were missing.
     Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=952823&view=rev
     2.2.x Patch: http://people.apache.org/~minfrin/httpd-cache-partial2-2.2.patch
     +1: minfrin
     -1: rpluem: Until the patch proposal above for mod_disk_cache is backported
                 and a similar patch for mod_mem_cache is proposed (no backport
                 possible since mod_mem_cache is no longer in trunk) and
                 committed.

   * mod_proxy: Release the backend connection as soon as EOS is detected,
     so the backend isn't forced to wait for the client to eventually
     acknowledge the data.
     Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1026665

     rpluem says: r1052224 r1052314 need to be added as well as the patch above
                  has a thread safety issue.
     minfrin: r1055246 needs to be added to r1052314 to ensure the cleanup
              isn't attempted twice.
     rpluem says: Mind to update the 2.2.x version of the patch with r1052224,
                  r1052314, r1055246 and r1055570 (Comment fix by Jim)?

  * cross-compile: allow to provide CC_FOR_BUILD so that gen_test_char will be
    compiled by the build compiler instead of the host compiler.
    Also set CC_FOR_BUILD to 'cc' when cross-compilation is detected.
    Since PCRE is included with 2.2.x this patch also takes care for dftables.
